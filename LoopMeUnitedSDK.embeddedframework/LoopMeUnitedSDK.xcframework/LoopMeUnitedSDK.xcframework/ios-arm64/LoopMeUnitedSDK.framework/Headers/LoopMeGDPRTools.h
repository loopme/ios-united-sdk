/**
 * The `LoopMeGDPRTools` class provides facilities for managing user consent.
 * Read more https://www.eugdpr.org/
 *
 * LoopMe SDK supports 3 cases of managing consents:
 * 1. If your application already has the Consent Management Platform (CMP) implemented, LoopMe SDK will automatically get consent string from the default storage.
 *
 * 2. You have no CMP implemented, LoopMe SDK shows GDPR consent pop-up to ask user for the consent for the first time.
 * 3. You manage users consent with your custom solution different from GDPR Consent Framework, then you can pass user consent by setting true or false value.
